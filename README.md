technitium dns dark theme

I did something for the dark theme, it's pretty nice as it is.

![dns-technitium](https://github.com/TechnitiumSoftware/DnsServer/assets/20106071/549dad4c-d53a-40c5-8a2d-bfe3450a2c7d)

Not perfect, but not bad...

If you want to use this dark theme, I am sharing the contents of **bootstrap.min.css** and **main.css** files in **/opt/technitium/dns/www/css**/ path here
